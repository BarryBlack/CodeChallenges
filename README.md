# CodeChallenges
The home of the JuniorDev coding challenges! These challenges are posted regularly to our Slack channel, so make sure you're on there and get involved!

## What is

These coding challenges have been taken from around the web for the JuniorDev TGA members to collaborate on to solve, test, and learn. To keep a record of these challenges and the solutions, we've created this repo so members can also practice their Git skills. The challenges are for everyone and we encourage members who have more experience to practice their unit test skills to then make sure the solutions coming in are fully tested.
The challenges can be solving a problem or refactoring existing code.

# these challenges are too easy! make something harder

We want everyone to be able to learn and attempt these challenges, so if you find these too easy then your job is to pass on your knowledge through code reviews and discussions, or by writing unit tests to try and break everything.

# these challenges aren't in my language of choice

We take all the help we can get from anyone and not everyone is going to be using the same language. If the challenge isn't in your coding language of choice, you can either use this as an opportunity to learn that language or contribute by rewriting the challenge in your language of choice (and submitting it for others) and then solving it.

# I can make better challenges than this

Awesome! To contribute to the challenges, just follow the same steps to get started and then make a new folder under /Challenges/ for your challenge. Challenges can be a written problem, bad working code that needs to be refactored, or code injested with bugs. See the steps below on how to do it and what you need to contribute.

## Getting Started

# first time

To get started, you need a Github account. Then follow:
1. Click the FORK button in the top right. This essentially copies this entire repo in it's current state to your account, so you can make changes and additions privately without affecting the original. You'll now be in your copy of the repo.
2. Click the green Clone or Download button and copy that link. We're going to use the command line to save this onto your computer :)
3. Open your chosen command line application of choice! Use the 'cd' command to
